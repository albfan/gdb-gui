A few notes on gdb improvements that would help the GUI:

* The dprintf code here required some hacks.
  Some kind of I/O redirection capability would be helpful.
  Also this would require being able to subclass a dprintf breakpoint.
  Alternatively, a hook on a Breakpoint that is called when a
  linespec is resolved would work.  Right now you can't make a pending
  "gui dprintf".

* Some events are missing.  This means the GUI can't properly react to
  changes.  For example:
  * No "new breakpoint" event.  (And this in turn means that more
    breakpoint types must be exposed.)

  * No "new shared library" event.

  * No "new thread" event.

  * No "frame selection" event, e.g. when user types "up".

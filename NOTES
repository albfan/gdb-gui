A few notes on gdb improvements that would help the GUI:

* The dprintf code here required some hacks.
  Some kind of I/O redirection capability would be helpful.
  Also this would require being able to subclass a dprintf breakpoint.
  Alternatively, a hook on a Breakpoint that is called when a
  linespec is resolved would work.  Right now you can't make a pending
  "gui dprintf".

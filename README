gdb-gui

This is gdb-gui, a GUI for gdb.  This GUI differs from existing gdb
GUIs in a few ways:

* It runs in-process.

* It is written in Python.

* It is intended to interoperate well with the CLI.
  You can pick and choose which windows you want to see, and you can
  still do whatever you like in the terminal.

* It is totally incomplete.


To get started, install the prerequisites.  You'll need a
Python-enabled gdb, PyGObject, and PyGktSourceView.  (And maybe more
-- if you trip across something, let me know.)  You'll need the Python
development package to compile the small C module that is included
here.

On Fedora I think this suffices:

    sudo yum install gdb python-devel gtksourceview3 pygobject3

After you install this, type "make".  Now, start gdb and source the
"SourceMe.py" file.  This sets everything up.  If you want it to
always be available, you can use "make hack-gdbinit", which will add
the appropriate "source" line to your ~/.gdbinit.

This adds a new "gui" command and various subcommands to gdb.

A simple subcommand to try is "gui source", which pops up a source
window.  The source window will automatically track your progress when
debugging.  You can make multiple source windows; they will be reused
in an LRU fashion.

If you want to hack on this, you will need Glade to edit the UI
elements.  For Fedora 18, you'll need a special hack to make the
gtksourceview widget visible to Glade.

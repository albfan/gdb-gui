gdb-gui

This is gdb-gui, a GUI for gdb.  This GUI differs from existing gdb
GUIs in a few ways:

* It runs in-process.

* It is written in Python.

* It is intended to interoperate well with the CLI.
  You can pick and choose which windows you want to see, and you can
  still do whatever you like in the terminal.

* It is totally incomplete.


To get started, install the prerequisites.  You'll need a
Python-enabled gdb, PyGtk, and PyGktSourceView.  (And maybe more -- if
you trip across something, let me know.)  You'll need the Python
development package to compile the small C module that is included
here.

On Fedora I think this suffices:

    sudo yum install gdb python-devel pygtksourceview pygtk2

After you install this, type "make".  Now, start gdb and source the
"SourceMe.py" file.  This sets everything up.

This adds a new "gui" command to gdb.  Currently the only subcommand
is "gui source", which pops up a source window.  The source window
will automatically track your progress when debugging.  You can make
multiple source windows; they will be reused in an LRU fashion.
